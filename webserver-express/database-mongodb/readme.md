## Node.js/Express-Webapp with Mongodb connection (with detailed step by step instructions)

This example shows how to start and use the provided nodejs-webserver with mongodb-connection.

#### Step 1

Install the mongod service (community edition) and mongo client.

MacOS:
For example, use homebrew as described in the documentation:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/


#### Step 2. The database-service "mongod" (Shell 1.)

Now open three shell instances for the (1.) database-service, (2.) webserver, and (3.) database operations respectiviely. Alternatively open them when needed.

Open a new shell-window and navigate to project folder (in which the data folder should be created):

    cd /<yourpath>/jslab/webserver-express/database-mongodb

Create the data folder:

    mkdir data

Start mongod (later stop via ctrl+c):

    mongod --dbpath=./data


#### Shell 2. The database-client (mongo)

Start mongo and connect to the mongod service (later use ctrl+ to stop mongo):

    mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017

To show all databases that contain data use:

    show databases

To operate on or create an item-database "itemdb" if not already created use:

    use itemdb
    show collections

Inspect the item-collection content (empty if the database was just created):

    db.item.find().pretty()

You can also use the item name or other parameters to search for specific items. For example:

    db.item.find({"name": "mongoitem"}).pretty()

The next commands are the crud-operations via mongo.

    db.item.insert({ "name" : "mongoitem", "description" : "testitem via mongo" })


Note that you will need the correct document id for the following commands. You may copy the id from the create-output for the following steps. You can later always use the find-command to retrieve the correct id (curser arrow up).

    db.item.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("5cf29783fdb12e0b4391b1c2")}, {$set: {description: "Changed testitem via mongo"}})
    db.item.find({"name": "mongoitem"}).pretty()

    db.item.deleteOne( { "_id" : ObjectId("5cf29783fdb12e0b4391b1c2") } )
    db.item.find({"name": "mongoitem"}).pretty()

#### Step 3 The mongodb-webserver (Shell 3.)

Navigate to the project folder:

    cd /<yourpath>/jslab/webserver-express/

You will find some mongodb-code has already been copied to the index.js file. Use these commands to initialize a new module for it and install the dependencies:

    npm init
    npm install --save express mongodb

Run the web server, by using the following command:

    node .

#### Step 4 Test the webserver (Browser and Shell 2.)

Open the webapp by using the following link:

http://localhost:3000/

Note that this is currently a route that responds JSON-Data (this is visible in the HTTP-Response-Headers) You can now make POST, PUT, DELETE or GET requests via the browsers webdeveloper tools, using a http tool, or create your websites with ajax-requests and/or forms sending the requests. Read the source code to find the routes or continue with the exercise.

Using the tool "httpie", try the http-requests for the CRUD operations:

    http get localhost:3000/
    http post localhost:3000/item name=foo description=bar
    http put localhost:3000/item _id=5cf29e1911ed24467ee2f119 name=foo description="changed description"
    http delete localhost:3000/item _id=5cf29783fdb12e0b4391b1c2

Also try to access the the specified url-routes via the webbrowser by opening the url-routes and then using the developer tools.

While testing the different options, also monitor the webserver outputs, and changes in mongo using the find() command.


#### How to continue:

This example has demonstrated how connect a webserver to a database, how the javascript-server can access it and make it available via http using url-routes. To follow up with connecting forms to the server see:

https://github.com/streuselcake/jslab/tree/master/webserver-express/request-form


From a different perspective, this example demonstrates how to create a basic api. It responds with json data ready to use by the client page. To follow up with connecting a webpage to the api via ajax see:

https://github.com/streuselcake/jslab/tree/master/webserver-express/database-mongodb-ajax
